            <li>Learned about basic concepts and skills of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</li>
            <li>The research focuses on the experience feedback issue in power plants maintenance and proposes a novel process of automatic construction and reasoning of<br>
                &emsp;knowledge graphs to support the intelligent maintenance of complex power equipment. </li>
            <li>We labeled the corpus manually. After choosing to train character-based vector as the pre-processing text, we trained the model with LatticeLSTM for named <br>
                &emsp;entity recognition and trained the Multi-grained lattice model to extract the relations between the entities.</li>
            <li>Our paper is accepted as a long paper of International Conference on e-Business Engineering (ICEBE) and published by Springer-Verlag. The paper also got  <br>
                &emsp;Best Paper Award on ICEBE conference.</li>
