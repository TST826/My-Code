    <p>I'm a junior student at <a href="https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute</a>. 
    <p>I'm interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. Recently, my team is working on knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintainance of power plant.
    <p>I am currently working on my bachelor degree of computer engineering . Last fall, I went to UIUC for exchange study for a semester.
    <p>A version of my CV and transcript can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZHcJqn2Ckqu0s0q2YRNuiatlzXP1ESTg/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.

    <b>Content</b>: knowledge graph construction for intelligent maintainance
        <li>The research project intends to extract knowledge and data from large number of non-structured power plant maintainance report and build knowledge graph based on relation between knowledge entities.</li>
        <li>We proposed a framework to build knowledge graph for power plant and our paper gets published on conference ICEBE 2019, and we are awarded as Best Paper of conference.</li>
        <li>We manually labeled part of maintainance report and did some experiment by applying Bi-LSTM-Lattice  model to extract knowledge. Currently we have a relatively good result with applying lattice model on named  entity extraction.</li>

    <h2>English Proficiency</h2> 
    <p>We are taught in English teaching environment, thus we could use English fluently in dialogue and writing.
